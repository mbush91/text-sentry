# TextSentry Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** November 1, 2026

**App:** TextSentry (`org.textsentry.app`). This policy applies to both the Google Play edition and the separately distributed sideload edition.

**Contact and privacy inquiries:** Please open a confidential inquiry through the repository's [security reporting](https://github.com/mbush91/text-sentry/security/advisories/new), or use [project support](https://github.com/mbush91/text-sentry/issues) without including any personal messages, phone numbers, or API credentials.

## What TextSentry does

TextSentry provides optional Google sign-in through AWS Cognito while current AI analysis remains bring-your-own-key (BYOK). TextSentry maintains a limited AWS account and key-management backend, but **does not send any SMS contents to that backend**. The app can retrieve an OpenRouter subscriber key after sign-in, but managed OpenRouter message analysis is not integrated into Android. There are no analytics or advertising SDKs.

**Google Play edition:** You decide what text to paste or explicitly share with the app. The Play edition does not read incoming messages automatically, cannot send messages automatically, does not request SMS/call-log permissions, and cannot inspect your SMS inbox. You may review and edit an AI suggestion, then manually open your existing SMS app to compose a reply. The SMS app, not TextSentry, sends it after your approval.

**Sideload edition:** After you explicitly enable monitoring and grant Android SMS permissions, eligible incoming SMS content and sender numbers can be evaluated through your configured AI provider. Auto-send is separately optional. WorkManager may hold unprocessed SMS and sender data in app-private on-device storage until processing and cleanup. Once evaluated, messages are saved into an app-private, AES-GCM-encrypted history (most recent 100 decisions). History includes the SMS sender, full processed text, evaluation time, TypeSafe model confidence, reply suggestion, Android send result and an explicit indicator that TextSentry did not delete the original SMS. The existing shorter decision outcomes, hashed deduplication records and timestamps are also kept. The full inbox is never read or copied.

## Information handled

- If you opt into Google sign-in/sign-up, Google and AWS Cognito process basic identity information (such as email address and Cognito user ID) and issue access, ID and refresh tokens. The system browser handles your Google password; TextSentry never sees it. The tokens are encrypted with a dedicated Android Keystore AES-GCM key and saved in app-private storage to keep your session between app launches. TextSentry AWS stores account identity and a monthly capped OpenRouter key (with its provider hash, period and expiration) in DynamoDB. The app obtains the key from the authenticated API only into volatile RAM; it is not stored with Cognito tokens or local message history. No SMS message bodies are sent to AWS. Users can sign out to clear the key from RAM; ending an app process also removes it. Provider key records can persist on AWS until rotated or revoked.
- Your TypeSafe API key, confidence threshold and instructions are stored locally on your device. The API key is encrypted using Android Keystore. The local message-history archive uses a separate Android Keystore-backed AES-256-GCM encryption key. The provider and model are not configurable.
- The text you explicitly submit in the Play edition, or eligible SMS body and sender in the sideload edition when monitoring is on, is transmitted **to TypeSafe AI (Jev System One)** to obtain an evaluation. The provider and model are fixed in this version. The generic chat interface uses a placeholder sender number for manually submitted Play text.
- The AI provider may process, store or retain submitted content in accordance with **its own privacy policy and terms**. Check those terms before sending private or sensitive text. Do not submit one-time codes, passwords or other sensitive content.
- In the Play edition, text submitted with your per-message consent and its probability/suggestion are stored in TextSentry's encrypted local history. The number you enter to compose an SMS is passed only to the installed SMS app selected by Android. TextSentry cannot verify whether the SMS app actually sent the message. TextSentry does not send that number to the AI provider.

## Optional developer diagnostics

A hidden developer mode can be enabled by seven taps on the **AI connection** heading in Settings, followed by confirmation. When enabled, TextSentry retains at most five **complete model request and response JSON pairs** in an AES-256-GCM encrypted local store protected by Android Keystore. These diagnostic request bodies include the original analyzed SMS text and the selected categories and extra instructions; response bodies contain the raw TypeSafe API reply. API keys and HTTP authorization headers are not included. This happens only for analyses already requested or permitted by the user, and does not add any network transmission or analytics. Developer mode also permits editing additional natural-language classifier restrictions. Turning it off stops new tracing, but existing encrypted traces remain until you clear them in developer tools, clear history, or delete all app data.

## Your choices and consent

Google sign-in is optional and provides a first-time sign-up or returning-user login without creating a TextSentry password. Signing in automatically tries to obtain a monthly $1-capped OpenRouter key for the account (current free-account beta); it does not activate automatic SMS monitoring or replies, a subscription, or use OpenRouter to analyze SMS. BYOK TypeSafe classification is unchanged. Signing out erases saved tokens from the app, not Google's existing browser cookies or the remote Cognito account; contact project support for account deletion inquiries.

In the Play edition, no message is submitted to AI without checking the consent box and selecting **Analyze**. That choice is reset after an analysis. In the sideload edition, you must separately enable SMS monitoring and automatic sending. You can pause sideload monitoring or delete local TextSentry data in either edition.

## Retention and deletion

TextSentry supports optional Google/Cognito accounts; sign-out and local data erasure do not delete the remote account or Google/AWS sign-in records. The History page keeps up to 100 encrypted results and offers a **Clear history** control; use **Clear local decision history** to remove TextSentry's encrypted history and short outcome log, **Delete all local TextSentry data** to remove all local app records, or Android Settings > Apps > TextSentry > Storage > Clear storage, to erase the locally stored configuration, API key, encrypted account tokens, decision history and deduplication records. TextSentry also cancels scheduled work when local data is deleted. These controls do **not** delete SMS messages from the device's default messaging app; inbox deletion requires default SMS handler capabilities that TextSentry does not currently provide. Deleting local data does not revoke the remote OpenRouter key or delete the remote Cognito/DynamoDB record; it only clears the in-memory key and saved OAuth session on this device. Deleting local data **cannot delete information already transmitted** to your independent AI provider; contact that provider for its deletion procedure.

## Sharing, security and children

TextSentry does not sell your data or share data for advertising. Data transmitted to your chosen provider uses HTTPS. Access to SMS in the sideload edition is controlled by Android permissions. TextSentry is not designed for children, and SMS classification is never guaranteed to be correct.

Sideload requests RECEIVE_SMS for opt-in monitoring and SEND_SMS for separately consented auto-replies, with in-app permission status and requests. SMS deletion would require TextSentry to be your actual default SMS app, which is not offered; a history row's "Not deleted by TextSentry" indicator does not assert whether another app subsequently deleted the message. Android send confirmations are used to distinguish a submitted send from a confirmed sent attempt. The Play edition and sideload edition have different permissions and functionality. This policy may be updated as the product changes; the dated version is published in this repository.
